This is a quick job, to have a local database, to collect _all_ commands
from ~/.bash_history

To couple with this, I have set a crontab job:
  */30 * * * * /home/vbatts/bin/bash_history.rb


and set in ~/.bashrc:
  unset HISTFILESIZE
  export HISTSIZE=10000
  export HISTTIMEFORMAT="%F %T "
  export HISTCONTROL="ignoreboth"


== USAGE
See the --help also,
